# ðŸ’¸ Stock Market Simulator (OOP Java Project)

A Java console application simulating basic stock and bond transactions using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Main.java` â€“ Entry point, handles user interaction
- `User.java` â€“ Base class for user logic (buy stock, bond, balance)
- `PremiumUser.java` â€“ Inherits from `User` and overrides interest logic

## ðŸ§  Java OOP Concepts Used

| Concept        | Where Itâ€™s Applied                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Class & Object | All 3 files use classes and objects  |
| Inheritance    | `PremiumUser extends User`           |
| Polymorphism   | Overridden `calculateInterest()`     |
| Encapsulation  | `private name`, `protected balance`  |
| Abstraction    | `buyStock()`, `buyBond()` hide logic |

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Buy Stocks and Bonds
- Track Balance
- Calculate Interest
- Uses Premium interest logic via inheritance
